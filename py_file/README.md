# Rock Paper Pencil Scissor Game

## Overview
This project is a fun, interactive desktop game created using Python's `tkinter` for GUI and `PIL` (Python Imaging Library) for image handling. Players can choose between "Rock," "Paper," "Pencil," and "Scissor" and compete against the system. The game tracks scores and allows players to choose the number of rounds, retry, or exit after a game ends.

## How to Run the Game (Executable Version)

### Requirements
Before running the game, ensure your system meets the following requirements:
- **Operating System**: Windows (The `.exe` file is built for Windows)
- **Memory**: Minimum 100MB of available RAM.
- **Disk Space**: At least 50MB of free space for game assets and the executable.
- **Dependencies**: The game executable includes all necessary dependencies, so no additional installations are required.

### Running the Game
1. **Download the Game**:
   - Obtain the `.exe` file from the folder where it is stored.

2. **Run the Executable**:
   - Double-click on the `.exe` file to launch the game.
   - The game will open in fullscreen mode, displaying a user interface with the title "Rock Paper Pencil Scissor."

3. **Game Instructions**:
   - Choose the number of rounds (5, 10, or 15) by clicking one of the round buttons.
   - Select one of the four options (Rock, Paper, Pencil, or Scissor) by clicking the corresponding button.
   - The system will make a random choice, and the winner will be displayed on the screen.
   - The scores for both the player and the system will be updated after each round.
   - Once the set number of rounds are completed, the final result will be displayed (Player Wins, System Wins, or Tie).
   - After the game ends, you can choose to:
     - **Retry**: Start a new game.
     - **Exit**: Close the application.

4. **Exiting the Game**:
   - Press the "Close" button at any time to exit the game.
   - You can also use the `Alt+F4` shortcut to close the application immediately.

### Troubleshooting
- **Graphics/Display Issues**: If the game does not display correctly, ensure your screen resolution is set to a standard aspect ratio (e.g., 16:9 or 16:10).
- **Missing Images**: If you see any missing images during the game, ensure that the `images` folder is present in the same directory as the `.exe` file and contains the following images:
  - `rock.png`
  - `paper.png`
  - `pencil.png`
  - `scissor.png`
  - `player.png`
  - `sys.png`
- **Performance**: If the game lags or runs slowly, close other programs running in the background to free up system resources.

### Known Limitations
- The game only supports Windows operating systems at this time.
- The game must be run on a system with a display resolution that supports fullscreen mode.
